Zach received his undergraduate degree in Genetics, Cell, and Developmental Biology and is currently a doctoral candidate in Evolutionary Biology at Arizona State University. He is interested in all of the intersections that cancer biology makes with evolutionary theory, particularly comparative oncology - the study of cancer across the tree of life. Zach is passionate about bringing evolution into the cancer clinic, as well as the community.
